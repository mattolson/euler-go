# euler-go

My solutions to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems) in [Go Lang](http://golang.org/).
This is a playground to discover idiomatic and/or efficient solutions. I have a separate
repository for each language due to constraints of some languages, particularly [Go](http://golang.org).
